# shiny-crypto

This is my first attempt at mixing cryptocurrencies, R shiny, and webscraping. I'll be using packages from the tidyverse (my favorite set of packages). This is a rather elementary exercise, but aims to demonstrate how packages can be combined easily to produce usable tools.


# Update 
I've added some currencies using the public api for coinmarketcap. Note that this coinmarketcap will eventually move away from this public api to a free version of a more enterprise-ish version. Sad day, but we should thank coinmarketcap for it has done so far--so if you're feeling generous and want to help coinmarketcap give us more free stuff, donate to one of the addresses you see at the bottom of the page (https://coinmarketcap.com). This is of course at your own discretion.
